# Frontend & Backend Enhancements (July 2025)

- Updated `style.css` with improved, modern styles for forms, buttons, selects, and layout, including subtle animations for a more interactive user experience.
- All previous styles are preserved and enhanced for better consistency and usability.
- Backend: Added/updated the `/api/sentiment-heatmap` endpoint in `app.py` to provide the "Sentiment Score Heatmap (Last 7 Days)" feature, aggregating sentiment scores for the last 7 days per stock.
- These changes improve both the look and functionality of the Enter News and Heatmap features.

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts stock prices by combining sentiment analysis of financial news with historical market data. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor is trained on engineered features to forecast trends and visualize price movement over the next 7 days.

The project uses:
- Real-time web scraping (LiveMint, MoneyControl)
- Sentiment analysis using VADER
- Stock data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- Feature engineering with technical indicators (support/resistance)
- MLP model for predictions
- MongoDB Atlas for data storage
- Flask + Docker for deployment

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Live news scraping via BeautifulSoup/Selenium
- ✅ VADER sentiment scoring with compound score (-1 to 1)
- ✅ yFinance-based stock price collection (Open, Close, High, Low)
- ✅ Data cleaning, normalization, Min-Max scaling
- ✅ Feature engineering: Previous Close, Price Change, Support/Resistance
- ✅ MLP Regressor with evaluation metrics: MSE, MAE, R²
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas for storing predictions/logs
- ✅ Visualization with Matplotlib
- ✅ Flask web interface
- ✅ Docker-ready deployment with Render & Vercel

## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Scrapes news from LiveMint, MoneyControl  
   - Pulls stock data using `yfinance`

2. **Preprocessing & Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Applies VADER sentiment scoring  
   - Aggregates sentiment on 7-day rolling window  
   - Cleans and normalizes data
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Merges sentiment and stock data  
   - Adds Previous Close, Price Change, Support, Resistance

5. **Prediction & Visualization**  
   - Forecasts next 7-day stock trends  
   - Plots actual vs predicted data

6. **Deployment**  
   - Dockerized Flask API  
   - Deployed using Vercel + Render  
   - MongoDB Atlas stores predictions
