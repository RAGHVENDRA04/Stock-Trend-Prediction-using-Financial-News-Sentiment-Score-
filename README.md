# Frontend & Backend Enhancements (July 2025)

- Updated `style.css` with improved, modern styles for forms, buttons, selects, and layout, including subtle animations for a more interactive user experience.
- All previous styles are preserved and enhanced for better consistency and usability.
- Backend: Added/updated the `/api/sentiment-heatmap` endpoint in `app.py` to provide the "Sentiment Score Heatmap (Last 7 Days)" feature, aggregating sentiment scores for the last 7 days per stock.
- These changes improve both the look and functionality of the Enter News and Heatmap features.
