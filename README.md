## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts stock prices by combining sentiment analysis of financial news with historical market data. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor is trained on engineered features to forecast trends and visualize price movement over the next 7 days.

The project uses:
- Real-time web scraping (LiveMint, MoneyControl)
- Sentiment analysis using VADER
- Stock data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- Feature engineering with technical indicators (support/resistance)
- MLP model for predictions
- MongoDB Atlas for data storage
- Flask + Docker for deployment

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Live news scraping via BeautifulSoup/Selenium
- ✅ VADER sentiment scoring with compound score (-1 to 1)
- ✅ yFinance-based stock price collection (Open, Close, High, Low)
- ✅ Data cleaning, normalization, Min-Max scaling
- ✅ Feature engineering: Previous Close, Price Change, Support/Resistance
- ✅ MLP Regressor with evaluation metrics: MSE, MAE, R²
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas for storing predictions/logs
- ✅ Visualization with Matplotlib
- ✅ Flask web interface
- ✅ Docker-ready deployment with Render & Vercel

## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Scrapes news from LiveMint, MoneyControl  
   - Pulls stock data using `yfinance`

2. **Preprocessing & Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Applies VADER sentiment scoring  
   - Aggregates sentiment on 7-day rolling window  
   - Cleans and normalizes data

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Merges sentiment and stock data  
   - Adds Previous Close, Price Change, Support, Resistance

4. **Model Training**  
   - Trains MLP Regressor using scikit-learn  
   - Evaluates using MSE, MAE, R²

5. **Prediction & Visualization**  
   - Forecasts next 7-day stock trends  
   - Plots actual vs predicted data

6. **Deployment**  
   - Dockerized Flask API  
   - Deployed using Vercel + Render  
   - MongoDB Atlas stores predictions

## 📊 Results

| Metric         | Value       |
|----------------|-------------|
| R² Score       | 0.72        |
| MAE            | 14.21       |
| MSE            | 308.77      |
